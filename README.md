# Analyze Cancer Diagnoses By Stage with Python
## Objective: Identify Early and Late-Diagnosed Cancers
* Find which of the four deadliest cancers tend to be diagnosed early in the localized stage, and which ones are usually diagnosed later in the distant stage when the cancer has spread more throughout the body.
* Put data from these four cancers onto a single chart so that the cancers are easy to compare.
